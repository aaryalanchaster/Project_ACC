Learn more about Training Goodlife Moments I needed to do something all my own that would make me happy: lose the weight I’d gained and get into the best shape of my life. My confidence started to soar with the weight dropping, muscles toning and strengthening, and people noticing the physical changes. That confidence and everything about the new Karen attracted lots of attention. Karen W Since I started going to GoodLife, my confidence sky rocketed. What makes me feel even better since I've been going to GoodLife is that the people around me see a huge difference and want me to educate them about a healthier life including what I do for exercise, and diet. Lizz In 2004 I was diagnosed with severe onset Rheumatoid Arthritis where every joint in my body was affected. It took me an hour every morning to fully engage my body. There was no walking, I shuffled. It took some years before I was able to get back to the GoodLife gym but with determination and believing I did it. I went from thinking I would never enter the gym again to now squatting 155lbs!

This land, and the land on which all GoodLife Fitness Clubs operate, continues to be home to diverse Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) whom we recognize as contemporary stewards of the land and vital contributors of our society.
