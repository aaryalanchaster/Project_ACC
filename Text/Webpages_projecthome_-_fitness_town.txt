Rooted in a background of health science and a passion for lives-well-lived, the Fitness Town Family of Companies is united in our vision to improve lives by creating environments for fitness that move people. Science tells us that our environment has a significant influence on our beliefs, habits, and overall success. Accepting that today’s busy life doesn’t work for fitness will lead us to the solution: we must change our environment so that it moves us to move more. With that in mind, we seek to shift the focus in our industry from product sales to creating personalized environments for fitness that inspire people to use and enjoy their fitness equipment regularly. In doing so, we hope to reverse some of the damage done by the gimmicks, fads, opportunistic discount market, high-pressure sales, muscle head vibe, ‘bro’ fitness, and slimming culture that the industry has leveraged – and restore peoples’ relationship with exercise equipment as a tool for moving more. Fitness Town is a Canadian company with 7 family-owned and operated fitness equipment retail stores in Burnaby, North Vancouver, Kitsilano, South Vancouver, Port Coquitlam, Langley and Edmonton. In addition is Fitness Town’s Commercial Fitness Equipment Division know throughout North America for facility designs like the 2010 Olympic gym, the Richmond Oval and alike.
