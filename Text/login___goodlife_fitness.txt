Sign Up Land Acknowledgement GoodLife Fitness was founded on the traditional lands of the Anishinaabek (Ah-nish-in-a-bek), Haudenosaunee (Ho-den-no-show-nee), Lūnaapéewak (Len-ahpay- wuk) and Attawandaron (Add-a-won-da-run) Peoples, on lands connected with the London Township and Sombra Treaties of 1796 and the Dish with One Spoon Covenant Wampum. This land, and the land on which all GoodLife Fitness Clubs operate, continues to be home to diverse Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) whom we recognize as contemporary stewards of the land and vital contributors of our society.
