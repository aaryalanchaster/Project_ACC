I always felt tired and uncomfortable about my body and also felt like my body was holding me back from doing the things that I wanted to do. But as I started to train and workout at GoodLife I have lost a substantial amount of weight and feel better than ever about my body. Now I can finally fit back into my favorite clothes! -Shila K. In May 2015, I decided I needed to do something just for me. I needed to do something all my own that would make me happy: lose the weight I&rsquo;d gained and get into the best shape of my life. My confidence started to soar with the weight dropping, muscles toning and strengthening, and people noticing the physical changes. That confidence showed in my smile, in my walk, everything about the new Karen attracted lots of attention. -Karen W. Since I started going to GoodLife, my confidence sky rocketed. What makes me feel even better since I've been going to GoodLife is that the people around me see a huge difference and want me to educate them about a healthier life including what I do for exercise, and diet. -Lizzy I was always overweight growing up. Since joining GoodLife I've lost 141 lbs. I'm almost half way to my goal, I have no more knee or back pain, and I walk as often as possible because it just feels great to do. With Goodlife, I've made a huge transformation and there will be nothing to prevent me from reaching my goal -Andrew O.

We know that everyone’s fitness journey is a personal one, so we’ve created our GoodLife Starter Programs with that in mind. Our goal is to help you find the options that work best for you, allow you to fall in love with fitness and make it part of your daily life. We want you to get the help and support you need, when you need it, along with showing you all the variety you now have available. There are many components of the GoodLife Starter Program outlined below. We hope that you will take advantage of them all. The purpose of the Program is to help you develop a plan for your first month of fitness, to provide valuable information to answer any questions you might have, and to make you feel welcome and comfortable in the Club. Personal Training Starter and LifeChanger: Personal Training provides you with the best possible start toward achieving your health and fitness goals. Your Trainer is focused on your goals, your health, well-being and your success. Through Starter Packages, you will build confidence as well as establish a habit of consistent workouts. This will guarantee your greatest success. Personal Training Starter Packages are available in 3 x one-hour and 6 x one hour packages. You start with the LifeChanger appointment where you get a clear picture of your current lifestyle and health factors, and receive solutions for every major component of your Health and Fitness: Nutrition, Exercise, Sleep, and Stress Management. This appointment is followed by 3 or 6, one-hour, one-on-one Personal Training sessions. We encourage new Members to begin with a Personal Trainer Starter Package plus LifeChanger. If you did not choose this option when you joined, this one-time offer is still available to you at any time. Fitness Starter: The Fitness Starter is a one-on-one 60-minute session with a Personal Trainer where you discuss your lifestyle, goals and preferences. You will also learn valuable information about your physical health (ie. your blood pressure and body composition). Following this assessment, the Personal Trainer will lead you through a 30-minute demonstration on fitness equipment in the Club. They will offer tips and recommendations for your first month of workouts to help get you started on a path to success. They will also share the multiple programming options that are available and make recommendations on what would work best for you such as one-on-one Personal Training or Team Training. Class Starter: We have a Class Starter that can fit everyone’s schedule and fitness goals. The Class Starter helps you figure out which class or classes are your favourites. To learn more about a class, drop by the front desk 15 minutes before any class, or book an appointment with one of our Associates to explain a class and introduce you to the Instructor. Fit-Fix Starter: Do you need a workout that is fast and convenient? Our GoodLife 20-Minute Fit-Fix is for you. This fast, effective and easy workout can get you results in just 20 minutes 3 times per week. This Starter appointment will show you how to use the Fit-Fix equipment as well as a proper warm-up. We also provide you with complete cardio training information. Youth Starter: For all Members who are 12-16 years old we have a mandatory Youth Starter. This Starter includes the Fit-Fix Starter along with the Youth Member FAQs and Club Etiquette. At the end of this Starter, you receive your Membership card and we ask that you try more options in our GoodLife Starter Program.

LEARN MORE Land Acknowledgement GoodLife Fitness was founded on the traditional lands of the Anishinaabek (Ah-nish-in-a-bek), Haudenosaunee (Ho-den-no-show-nee), Lūnaapéewak (Len-ahpay- wuk) and Attawandaron (Add-a-won-da-run) Peoples, on lands connected with the London Township and Sombra Treaties of 1796 and the Dish with One Spoon Covenant Wampum. This land, and the land on which all GoodLife Fitness Clubs operate, continues to be home to diverse Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Inuit and Métis) whom we recognize as contemporary stewards of the land and vital contributors of our society.
