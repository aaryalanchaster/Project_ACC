Curling Attachments Leg curls are also a great way to increase and tone the muscles long the backs of the legs. This attachment can also help with toning the buttocks. As with the leg press attachment, add more plates to increase the weight and resistance. Take a look at attachments that help to firm and tone the lower body and the legs today. After setting them up and working a few new routines into the workout, it will be easy to see why these resources are so popular.
