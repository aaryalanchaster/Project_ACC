Some of them will even make exercise seem like play again. Here are some examples of rig accessories that should be part of a home gym. Monkey Bars Made from high-quality metal, monkey bars are capable of sustaining plenty of weight. They can be used for swinging, chin-ups, and a number of other physical activities. Easy to install and capable of lasting for many years, they are also an excellent way to enjoy some quick exercise on rest days. Wall Ball Target It’s easy to mount a wall ball target on a rig and use it to play a game for some relaxation. Wall ball involves using a ball that strikes the floor and then bounces upward to strike a target. This type of game can be used to improve response times, aim, and will involve moving around to retrieve the ball for another toss. Angled Rigs Along with square rigs, it’s possible to invest in an angled rig. This design is more versatile in terms of exercises that can be done using the framework. Take a look at a few rigs and accessories today. Think of how they could be put to good use during a daily workout or as a way to let off some steam after a hard day. The right choices will ensure that working out is always fun.
